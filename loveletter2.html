                <h1 class="title">Dear Baba,</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy anniversary! I'm sorry this is not as "ma-effort" as my previous gifts and doings on our last anniversary, I don't have the money na eh hehe.</p>
                <p>But still, I've been making this website for you for the past 3 hours I think. It's currently 1:37 AM and I'm having a hard time making this kasi it's my first time and I'm still learning through videos huhu.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I want to say that I'm really glad, and I mean it, that I saw how beautiful you were on that day I had a crush on you. I wonder how things would've went if our paths didn't cross each other. But I'm happy it didn't.</p>
                <p>Thank you my love for always supporting me, loving me, being with me, and coping with my attitudes and feelings hehe. Do know that no matter what nga away naton, deep down I still love you.</p>
                <p>730 days may seem a lot, pero for me kulang pa. It's not enough time with you and I wish that for us to increase the days throughout our life with our love for each other.</p>
                <p>I'm really happy that I met you my baba, bubu, luvie, baby, choot, and so on... Even that many names, they all belong to the one I love, and that is you.</p>
                <p>Love,</p>
                <p>Your baba</p>
